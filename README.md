## How to run this project on your computer:

After cloning this repository, in the project folder we need to install the dependencies. You can either use yarn or npm for this. Use the command:

### `yarn`

or

### `npm install`

Now for running the project, if you installed the dependencies using yarn, run:

### `yarn start`

or if you used npm, run:

### `npm start`

ThatÂ´s it! The project will automatically open up in your default browser, using the url: 

### `http://localhost:3000`


## Scripts that I used to build and deploy:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run deploy`
